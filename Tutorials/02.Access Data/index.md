# Access Data

You can access repository data in two ways:

1. Python API
    * Fetch signals as a Pandas DataFrame - [Load Signals in python](../../Infrastructure%20Library/Medial%20Tools/Python/Examples.md#load-some-signals)

2. Tools and UI
    * Use `Flow` to print signal summaries or export data - [Flow view signals](../../Infrastructure%20Library/Medial%20Tools/Using%20the%20Flow%20App/index.md#printing-pids-and-signals)
    * Open a single patient with the repository viewers UI - [Repository viewers](../../Infrastructure%20Library/DataRepository/Repository%20Viewers.md)
