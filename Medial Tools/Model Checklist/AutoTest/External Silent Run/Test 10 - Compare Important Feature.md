# Test 10 - Compare Important Feature

**Overview**
One more test exploring the differences between the current dataset, and the dataset that was used to train the model, from the important features aspect (and see also Test 2).
 
**Parameters (see env.sh)**
All parameters are included in env.sh and described in [External Silent Run](../External%20Silent%20Run).
In particular, this test uses:

- CMP_FEATURE_RES=... list of important features for the model, with resolution 
****
**What is actually done?**
Several test and graphs per important feature.
 
**Test Results Review**
In the log file 07.feature_analysis.log, for every feature, we get something like the following (but note that we need to check the the similarity measure (KLD). :

In features_stat.tsv, we get similar results, without separation male/female and without similarity measures, but with missing value rate in the test.

Last, we have graphical histogram (with the defined resolution above) in the directory features_graphs.
 
**How to read the results?**
This test repeats part of Test 2, in a slightly difference way, with separation male/female. Thus, when we see differences in a specific feature in Test 2, we can use the output here to further investigate the gaps.
