# Test 05 - Compare Repository with Reference Matrix

## Purpose

Compare the generated repository against a reference matrix to quantify dataset differences and identify features that drive separation. This helps estimate likely impacts on model performance and prioritise follow-up checks.

## Required Inputs
From `configs/env.sh`:

- `WORK_DIR`: Output folder path where compare outputs will be written
- `MODEL_PATH`: Path to the fitted model (the script uses `${WORK_DIR}/model/model.medmdl` if present)
- `REFERENCE_MATRIX`: Full path to the reference matrix (feature matrix from model training)
- `CMP_FEATURE_RES`: Comma-separated list of important features and resolutions (e.g., `Age:1,MCH.slope.win_0_1000:0.01`). Used to build a restricted separation model limited to important features.

## How to Run
From your TestKit folder, execute:
```bash
./run.specific.sh 5
```
Or include as part of the full suite:
```bash
./run.sh
```

Outputs appear under `${WORK_DIR}/compare` and `${WORK_DIR}/compare.no_overfitting`.

## What This Test Does

Using the [TestModelExternal](../../../TestModelExternal.md) workflow, the test performs two comparisons:

- A full comparison using all model features (output: `${WORK_DIR}/compare`).
- A restricted comparison that uses only the important features derived from `CMP_FEATURE_RES` (output: `${WORK_DIR}/compare.no_overfitting`).

For each comparison the test:

- Computes per-feature statistics (mean, std, missing counts) and statistical tests (Mann–Whitney U)
- Trains a separation/propensity model to measure how separable the new dataset is from the reference (reports AUC and related metrics)
- Produces a Shapley-style feature importance report for the separation model (`shapley_report.tsv`) and per-feature plots (`features_diff`)
- Creates HTML diagnostic reports; the script prepares a local Plotly HTML template and patches script paths so generated HTML is portable within the docs site

The compare run is guarded by timestamp checks and will skip re-running if outputs are newer than inputs, unless overridden by the test environment.

## Output Location

- `${WORK_DIR}/compare` — full comparison (all features)
- `${WORK_DIR}/compare.no_overfitting` — restricted comparison using features listed in `CMP_FEATURE_RES`

Key artifacts inside each directory:

- `compare_rep.txt` — per-feature textual summary and tests
- `test_propensity.bootstrap.pivot_txt` — separation model / propensity results (AUC etc.)
- `shapley_report.tsv` — feature importance ranking for the separation model
- `features_diff/` — plots comparing distributions for top differing features
- `ButWhy/` — HTML dashboards produced from the shapley report

## How to Interpret Results

The goal is to detect distributional shifts that might affect model performance and to identify the features responsible. Use the outputs as follows:

- `compare_rep.txt` contains two sections: a summary block and a tabular section with per-feature stats and Mann-Whitney p-values. The tabular section is typically loaded into a DataFrame for analysis.
- Mann-Whitney p-values point to distributional differences but do not capture all changes (e.g., variance differences with similar medians). Treat p-values as a signal for inspection, not automatic rejection.
- `test_propensity*` outputs report how separable the datasets are. AUC ~ 0.5 indicates little separation (preferred). Very high AUC (e.g., ~1.0) indicates strong separation and suggests problems for matching-based performance estimation in next steps.
- `shapley_report.tsv` and `features_diff/` plots are used to prioritise features for investigation. Always check `Age` first as many differences can be age-proxies.

When AUC is high, prefer the restricted results in `compare.no_overfitting` (which isolates important features) to assess likely impact on model performance.

- `AUC_Mean` close to 0.5 is desirable - values near 1.0 require investigation.
- Use `shapley_report.tsv` to find which features drive separation. If those features are important to the model, further action is needed.
- Visualize suspect features using `features_diff` plots to confirm distributional shifts and check for imputation artifacts.

### Suggested code to analysis compare_rep.txt

Run the following code to turn compare_rep.txt into readable dataframes.

```python
f = os.path.join(DIR, 'compare/compare_rep.txt')
t2 = pd.read_csv(f, sep= '\r')
t2 = t2[t2[t2.columns[0]].map(lambda x: x[0:3])=='MAN']
cut = t2.index.min()
t21 = pd.read_csv(f, nrows=cut)
t21['status'] = t21.index.map(lambda x: x[0].split(' ')[0])
t21['feature'] = t21.index.map(lambda x: x[0].split('::')[0].rstrip().split(' ')[-1])
t21['TRAIN mean'] = t21.index.map(lambda x: x[0].rstrip().split('mean=')[1])
t21['TRAIN std'] = t21.index.map(lambda x: x[1].rstrip().split('=')[1])
t21['TRAIN miss_cnt'] = t21.index.map(lambda x: x[2].rstrip().split('=')[1].split("|")[0])
t21['TEST mean'] = t21.index.map(lambda x: x[2].rstrip().split('mean=')[1])
t21['TEST std'] = t21[t21.columns[0]].map(lambda x: x.rstrip().split('=')[1])
t21['TEST miss_cnt'] = t21[t21.columns[1]].map(lambda x: x.split('|')[0].split('=')[1].rstrip())
t21['mean_diff_ratio'] = t21[t21.columns[1]].map(lambda x: x.split('mean_diff_ratio=')[1].split('|')[0].rstrip())
t21['IMP'] = t21[t21.columns[1]].map(lambda x: x.split(' ')[-1])
cols = ['status', 'feature', 'TRAIN mean', 'TRAIN std', 'TRAIN miss_cnt', 'TEST mean', 'TEST std', 'TEST miss_cnt', 'mean_diff_ratio', 'IMP'] 
t21 = t21[t21.status=='BAD'][cols].reset_index(drop=True)
 
t22 = pd.read_csv(f, skiprows=cut+1, sep='\t')
```
The first dataframe, t21, should be ignored.
t21 shows moments, range and missing values count, for every feature, comparing the reference to the new dataset.

The second dataframe, t22, shows the same information (without range), plus Mann Whitney test result.

- _1 is for the new dataset
- _2 is for the reference
- The Mann-Whitney U Test assesses whether two sampled groups are likely to derive from the same population, but note test limitations - if median and shape are the same for both samples, P_value would be high even for different std/scale.

In table t22: t21 shows moments, range, and missing value counts for every feature, comparing reference to new dataset.

- We need to make sure we don't see low P_value for any important feature to the model, or proxy for such features, i.e.. we may list MCH.min.win_0_180 as important feature, and we don't want it or MCH.min.win_0_360 to have low P-value.
- We need to understand the reasons for the low P-value when happened, in order to better understand the new data set. For instance, in the table above, we see that in the tested dataset RDW was not given close to sample point, probably because it is not part of the panel. As RDW is not an important signal, we can ignore it.

#### Example

AUC_Mean is 0.98 - very high. However no significant different seen in compare_rep.txt 
Here is the Graph of a specific signal with big difference form shapley analysis:

<img src="../../../../attachments/13926455/13926485.png"/>
We see that the reference has several dominant values and this is due to imputations.

- In this case we use as reference a dataset different from the one we use for model training and feature importance.
- However, the reference dataset has many missing values for the relevant signal and imputations were generated that resulted in a binned, different resolution and distribution of the feature. It is of cource undesired situation, but not neccaraly very bad. The model was performing well in the dataset in spite of those missing values and imputations.
- Lesson learned is that we need to use as reference the original dataset (test samples only).

The reference matrix was generated again and than the AUC of this comparising dropped significantly.

## Notes and Implementation Details

- A temporary Plotly-based HTML template is created at `${WORK_DIR}/tmp/plot_with_missing.html` and patched so HTML reports reference `js/plotly.js` relative to the documentation output.
- `CMP_FEATURE_RES` is parsed into a feature list (`${WORK_DIR}/tmp/feat_list`) which the restricted comparison uses.
- The test uses subsampling limits (`--sub_sample_test`, `--sub_sample_train`, `--sub_sample_but_why`) to bound runtime and memory; these can be tuned in the script.

## Troubleshooting

- If `TestModelExternal` or `feature_importance_printer.py` are missing, make sure the TestKit resources are available on PATH in `configs/env.sh`.
- Slow runs or memory errors: reduce subsample sizes (`MAX_SIZE` in the script) or increase available memory for the Python process.
- Very high AUC but no obvious per-feature differences: check whether irrelevant features produce separation (use `compare.no_overfitting`) or whether imputation/binned reference values are causing artifacts.
- Broken HTML reports: confirm `${WORK_DIR}/tmp/plot_with_missing.html` exists and that `js/plotly.js` is reachable relative to the generated report locations.
